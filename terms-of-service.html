            <h2>1. Acceptance and scope</h2>
            <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Firm’s website www.casagar.co.in (the “Site”). They apply only to the Site. Any professional engagement for accounting, audit, tax or advisory services is governed exclusively by a separate written engagement letter and these Terms do not amend or supersede such engagement letters.</p>

            <h2>2. Permitted use and acceptable conduct</h2>
            <p>You may use the Site for lawful purposes only. Prohibited conduct includes: uploading unlawful, defamatory, obscene or infringing material; sending unsolicited commercial communications; transmitting malware; attempting unauthorised access; impersonation; or otherwise interfering with Site operations. We may report unlawful acts to appropriate authorities and will cooperate with lawful investigations. We may remove content and suspend or terminate access where violations are suspected.</p>

            <h2>3. Automated harvesting and scraping prohibited</h2>
            <p>You shall not use automated means (bots, scrapers, crawlers or similar tools) to harvest content or data from the Site without our prior written consent. We reserve the right to block, pursue remedies and report such activity.</p>

            <h2>4. No professional advice; no professional-client relationship</h2>
            <p>Content on the Site is for general information only and does not constitute professional advice. Submission of enquiries or materials via the Site does not create a professional-client relationship. Such relationship arises only upon execution of a formal written engagement letter signed by authorised representatives.</p>

            <h2>5. Intellectual property</h2>
            <p>All Site content (text, graphics, logos, images) is owned by the Firm or licensed to the Firm and protected by IP laws. You are granted a limited licence to view Site content for personal or internal business purposes only. Reproduction or commercial use is prohibited without prior written consent.</p>

            <h2>6. User content; licence and warranty</h2>
            <p>By submitting User Content, you warrant you have the necessary rights and consents and that the content does not infringe third-party rights. You grant the Firm a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide licence to use, reproduce, adapt and publish such User Content for Site operation and lawful Firm purposes.</p>

            <h2>7. Indemnity</h2>
            <p>Subject to applicable law , you agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Firm, its partners, employees and agents harmless from liabilities, losses, damages, claims and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or User Content.</p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of liability; professional exceptions</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Firm’s aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these Terms or your use of the Site shall be limited to the aggregate amount, if any, you have paid the Firm for use of the Site in the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to liability . The Firm shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (including loss of profits, business interruption or loss of data), even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Nothing in this clause limits liability which cannot be excluded by law (including death or personal injury caused by gross negligence) or liability that is prohibited from being limited by the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, ICAI professional standards, or any applicable engagement letter.</p>

            <h2>9. Suspension and termination</h2>
            <p>We may suspend, restrict or terminate access to the Site (wholly or partly) at our discretion for breach, suspected illegal activity, security reasons or maintenance. Termination will not affect accrued rights.</p>

            <h2>10. Notices and electronic communications</h2>
            <p>By using the Site you consent to receiving electronic communications from the Firm. Notices may be provided by e-mail or by posting on the Site.</p>

            <h2>11. Entire agreement; severability</h2>
            <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and other incorporated documents, constitute the entire agreement regarding the Site. If a provision is held unenforceable, the remainder continues in force.</p>
