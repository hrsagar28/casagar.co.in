Key factors determining the tax are the holding period (long-term vs. short-term), the cost of acquisition, improvement costs, and the sale price. It's crucial to plan this in advance as there are several exemptions available (like re-investing in another property or specified bonds) that can significantly reduce or even nullify your tax liability. We strongly advise a consultation before you finalize the sale."

                                <p class="px-6 pb-6 text-gray-700">The sale of a property results in capital gains, which are taxable. Key factors determining the tax are the holding period (long-term vs. short-term), the cost of acquisition, improvement costs, and the sale price. It's crucial to plan this in advance as there are several exemptions available (like re-investing in another property or specified bonds) that can significantly reduce or even nullify your tax liability. We strongly advise a consultation before you finalize the sale.</p>
